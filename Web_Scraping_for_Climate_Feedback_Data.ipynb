The claim relies on a study recently published in Nature by Banerjee et al.[1]. Previous studies have demonstrated that global total ozone is recovering and has the potential to fully recover by the end of the century[2,3,4], providing support for this claim. However, scientists emphasize that the article misrepresents the focus of the Banerjee paper, as described in their comments below. The claim and study it is based on focus on the Antarctic ozone layer, which has shown patterns of healing in response to reductions in ozone-depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)[1-4]. But rather than showing that the Antarctic ozone is healing, Banerjee et al. (2020) demonstrate that atmospheric circulation trends that were driven by ozone depletion have paused or reversed in the Southern Hemisphere[1]. SCIENTISTS\\u2019 FEEDBACK  William Seviour, Vice Chancellor's Research Fellow, University of Bristol:The claim that \\u201cthe ozone layer is healing and has the potential to fully recover\\u201d I believe is accurate. I\\u2019ll break this claim into its two parts. First, whether the ozone layer is healing: The focus of the article and paper is on Antarctic ozone, and there have now been some studies suggesting we are starting to see a healing signal there. This is quite tricky to detect because there is a lot of natural variability from year-to-year. Solomon et al. (2016) was probably one of the first[2]. Trends are a bit clearer looking at ozone over the whole globe (not just Antarctica). The SPARC LOTUS report is a good reference here\\u2014Fig. 1 of the Executive summary shows increasing ozone trends after 1997 in most places[3].  Figure\\u2014Satellite and ground-based records show ozone trends (% change in ozone amount) at different levels in the stratosphere before 1997 (top row) compared to post-2000 (bottom row). Columns represent different latitudes around the world: southern latitudes (left), tropical latitudes (middle), and northern latitudes (right). Note the trends in ozone concentrations are negative pre-1997 (upper panel), but neutral and positive post-2000 (bottom panel). From the SPARC LOTUS report (2019)[3]. Second, the potential to fully recover: The authoritative reference on this subject is the latest (2018) WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion\\u2014e.g. see Figure ES-1 of the Executive Summary[4]. This shows that ozone concentrations (both global and Antarctic) are projected to recover to 1960 levels by the end of this century.  Figure\\u2014Comparisons of total ozone observations (red points and lines) and chemistry climate models (black lines with grey regions showing uncertainty) for the globe (top) and Antarctic (bottom). Annual global total ozone is averaged over 60\\u00b0N to 60\\u00b0S latitudes, whereas Antarctic total ozone is averaged over 60\\u00b0S to 80\\u00b0S latitudes. Models project that ozone concentrations will return to levels observed in the 1960s by 2100, assuming future compliance with the Montreal Protocol, which is an international treaty designed to limit ozone-depleting substances, and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions following the RCP-6.0 scenario@. Black lines with arrows indicate the years that ozone abundances are projected to return to values observed in 1980. Adapted from World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Executive Summary: Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion (2018)[4]. The evidence linking ozone recovery to reductions in CFCs is very strong, so this claim is accurate. There have been a series of papers, such as Morgenstern et al. (2008), looking at \\u201cworld avoided\\u201d scenarios without the Montreal Protocol and they all show much larger ozone depletion[5]. There has been some recent evidence of violations in the Montreal Protocol with production of a particular CFC (CFC-11) linked to China[6]. Dhomse et al. (2019) has suggested that this violation might delay ozone recovery if it continues[7]. My main criticism of the article is that it largely misses the point of the paper. The paper is not directly about whether the ozone layer is healing, but whether atmospheric circulation changes that have been attributed to ozone depletion are pausing or reversing. Plenty of previous studies (linked above) have looked at recovery of ozone trends, but looking at the circulation trends is new. The fact that the paper shows they are reversing is good news because these changes have been linked to droughts over Australia for instance. I think this Guardian article does a better job at focusing on the winds, not just the ozone. In summary, I think the article is accurate but does not do a very good job of focusing on the results of the paper.  Paul Young, Lecturer, Lancaster University:The claim that \\u201cthe ozone layer is healing and has the potential to fully recover\\u201d is broadly accurate, backed up by several studies. In general, the best sources of information for those interested in the state of the ozone layer, and the levels and emissions of the synthetic substances that can harm it, are the 4-yearly scientific reports produced under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). These reports are written by scientists from all over the world, who assess and review the body of scientific evidence in the peer-reviewed literature. The most recent of these reports was published in 2018[4]. For the specific case of the Antarctic ozone hole, the WMO/UNEP report concluded that there is evidence to show that the hole is beginning to shrink in size, all as a result of the actions of the 1987 Montreal Protocol (and its amendments), which has strong controls on the emissions of halogen-containing ozone depleting substances. However, it is important to note that the ozone hole still continues to appear in southern hemisphere spring every year, and will likely continue to do so beyond the middle of this century (e.g., see Dhomse et al., 2019)[8]. This is because of the long lifetime of many ozone depleting substances in the atmosphere, meaning that they persist even after emissions are essentially zero (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs). As the Banerjee et al. Nature paper discusses, the Antarctic ozone hole has also been an important driver of southern hemisphere (SH) climate change, sometimes in a way that is opposite to the effects of the most important human-emitted greenhouse gas, CO2[4]. One of the most important ways in which the ozone hole has impacted SH climate is through pulling the SH jet stream more towards the poles. Among other effects, this has led to a poleward (=southward) trend in rainfall, since the jet stream is basically synonymous with where storms happen. Consistent with the emergence of healing of the ozone hole, their work demonstrates that the ozone hole-driven climate effects are beginning to reverse. In terms of recovery of the world-wide ozone layer, the story is a little more nuanced. As the UNEP/WMO report notes (chapter 3), there is no statistically significant recovery of the total amount of ozone[9]. Detection of recovery is hampered by large, natural year-to-year variability in the atmosphere (\\u201cthe weather\\u201d), which in turn drives large ups and downs in the ozone layer. Nevertheless, one place where the ozone layer is showing clear signs of recovery is the upper stratosphere, which is 35-45km, or ~20-30 miles, up. The recovery here is being driven both by the gradual decreases in ozone depleting substances, but also a slow down in the chemical reactions that destroy ozone. This slowdown is because the upper atmosphere is cooling due to the increases in greenhouse gases (e.g. Thompson et al. (2012); see Box 5-1 of the WMO/UNEP report for an explanation)[10,11].  A. R. Ravi Ravishankara, Distinguished Professor, Colorado State University:The findings of the paper are not unexpected since this is what should happen as the ozone hole is starting to heal. The indicators that the ozone hole is showing signs of healing has been known for a few years. This paper shows that the trends in tropospheric circulation due to the ozone hole not getting bigger and showing some healing is detectable. This is great. I want to change the phraseology of the paper. The ozone hole is not really \\u201chealing,\\u201d it is not getting worse and has stayed just as bad for the past few years as the equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) has been nearly constant. I hasten to add that the ozone hole is one indicator of the ozone layer depletion. It is just that the ozone hole is a large signal that is periodic. So, the consequences of its changes are much larger than the global ozone layer depletion starting its course towards its pre-ozone depleting gases state. So, one should expect to detect these changes due to ozone hole changes (but it is really not getting better\\u2014just not getting worse!) The Ozone Layer Assessments have clearly indicated that the ozone hole and its \\u201crecovery\\u201d is least influenced by climate changes.\\u00a0 It has also shown that the EESC controls the ozone hole well into the future, unlike the global ozone layer changes that are more influenced by climate change (especially stratospheric cooling and the chemical activity of \\u201cclimate gases\\u201d such as methane and N2O). So, I wonder how circulation changes play out in the future globally. This paper has mixed up the issues between the global ozone layer and the ozone hole.\\u00a0 So, I hasten to add that there are no indicators of the changes in tropospheric climate from the global ozone layer depletion or its changes. One should ask what is happening in the Arctic ozone changes (larger depletions than globally but less than the ozone hole) in the Northern winter/spring. That would be nice to know. There has been much written about the \\u201cworld avoided\\u201d by not continuing to increase ODS and the influence of the Montreal Protocol. So, one should also ask what major tropospheric climate changes have been avoided by the Montreal Protocol. I was surprised to not see anything about it. Also, it is important to know that the ozone hole is still pretty large. It is to be expected to continue for decades. The EESC is not changing much. Their Figure 1a shows the small change in EESC. The responses shown in the paper should be viewed as responses due to the absence of continued increases in the ozone hole. I wonder what the circulation changes signals would be when there are sudden stratospheric warmings and hence much smaller ozone holes (i.e., if we focused only on the sudden warming years). Lastly, I want to note that chemically, the ozone hole is not linearly dependent on EESC.\\u00a0 That is why it appeared only in the 1980s and one would expect the changes to be small as long as the EESC is still high. Indeed, our study supports this claim. There already exists observational evidence that the actions of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 have led to declines in atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting substances (the CFCs). The production and consumption of these substances was banned by the treaty in an effort to prevent further destruction of the ozone layer. This seems to have been effective: there have been signs that the ozone layer is recovering[2,4]. Measurements show that ozone in the upper stratosphere outside of the polar regions has been increasing by 1-3% per decade since around 2000. The Antarctic ozone hole \\u2013 the most severe example of ozone depletion \\u2013 has also started to shrink since around 2000, even though the hole is still occurring every year. In the last few decades of the 20th century, there have been some striking changes in the large-scale wind patterns of the Southern Hemisphere during summertime. Notably, the midlatitude jet stream has been shifting towards the South Pole and the tropics have been widening[12]. Antarctic ozone depletion has been shown to be the main driver of these changes[11,13]. The new finding in our paper is that these trends in the Southern Hemisphere circulation have stopped, and might even be reversing, since around the year 2000. Crucially, we use model simulations to attribute this lack of trends to the reduction in ozone-depleting substances due to the Montreal Protocol and the healing of the Antarctic ozone hole. This is therefore yet another sign, this time in the wind patterns, of the effects of the Montreal Protocol. @: A Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) is a greenhouse gas concentration trajectory used by the IPCC. RCP-6.0 is an intermediate scenario in which radiative forcing stabilizes at 6.0 W m-2 after 2100.\",\n          \"A letter published on August 14 by CLINTEL, a group that claims to have the support of \\u201c1,609 scientists and professionals\\u201d, repeats a series of familiar myths about climate science to arrive at its declaration that \\u201cthere is no climate emergency\\u201d. The group has published similar claims about climate science in the same letter format in 2022 and 2019, both of which were previously analyzed by Climate Feedback, here and here. This year\\u2019s edition of the letter was covered by dozens of online blogs and news sites, including the Epoch Times, an outlet that has also previously published science misinformation. The letter first claims that \\u201cit is no surprise that we are now experiencing a period of warming\\u201d because the \\u201cLittle Ice Age ended as recently as 1850\\u201d. The Little Ice Age refers to a period of slight cooling, typically defined as occurring from the mid-16th to mid-19th century that was particularly strongly expressed in the northern hemisphere (Fig. 1)[1]. Scientists have proposed a variety of explanations for the cause of the Little Ice Age, including reduced solar activity[2], variations in atmospheric circulation patterns[1], changes in North Atlantic ocean circulation and ice dynamics[3], large volcanic eruptions[4], and even human-driven land-use change triggered by European colonialism[5].  Figure 1. Reconstructions and observations of global temperature change over the last two millennia. The magnitude of temperature change during the Little Ice Age, denoted by the blue-shaded region of the plot, is far outweighed by current warming. Source: Climate Lab Book Here, the letter is implying that post-industrial warming resulted naturally from the end of this cool interval, which climate scientists say is not accurate. Climate scientists have parsed out the influence of human-caused and natural factors on global mean surface temperature, and have concluded that contemporary warming is due to human activity (Fig. 2)[6,7]. As Timothy Osborn, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia, remarked in comments to Climate Feedback for a previous review of a similar claim, \\u201c[N]atural warming after the Little Ice Age was complete by the late 1800s. The warming from the late 1800s to the present is all due to human-caused climate change, because natural factors have changed little since then and even would have caused a slight cooling over the last 70 years rather than the warming we have observed\\u201d (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. (left) Unprecedented rate of warming since 1850 and (right) observed (black) and simulated temperature change since 1850 with (brown) and without (green) human factors. Note that natural factors alone are insufficient to explain the unprecedented post-industrial rate of warming as documented in observations. Source: IPCC AR6 The letter goes on to claim that \\u201cwarming is far slower than predicted\\u201d and that \\u201c[t]he world has warmed significantly less than predicted by IPCC [the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] on the basis of modeled anthropogenic forcing\\u201d. However, the results from IPCC models shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the current suite of IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) models accurately captures the observed warming since 1850. Earlier climate models have also generally been skillful at simulating global mean surface temperature (Fig. 3)[8]. While some models have overestimated warming, others have underestimated it. As the authors of a 2019 paper[8]\\u00a0that explored the performance of projections by climate models over the last several decades put it, \\u201cWe find no evidence that the climate models evaluated in this paper have systematically overestimated or underestimated warming over their projection period\\u201d. By suggesting that climate models have exclusively overestimated warming, the CLINTEL letter is engaging in cherry-picking\\u2013selectively reporting on only the results that match a desired outcome while excluding other pieces of relevant scientific evidence.  Figure 3. Average of model-simulated temperature change from the IPCC\\u2019s first assessment report published in 1990 (black) against various temperature observations (colors). Source: Carbon Brief According to the letter, carbon dioxide (CO2), the greenhouse gas that is predominantly responsible for modern warming, is \\u201cplant food\\u201d that is both \\u201cfavorable for nature\\u201d and \\u201cincreas[es] the yield of crops worldwide\\u201d. However, scientists say that this claim oversimplifies the relationship between plants and CO2. \\u201cThe benefit[s] of increasing CO2 concentrations for plant growth are increasingly being outweighed by the negative impacts, especially of global warming\\u201d, said Sara Vicca, a plant biologist and biogeochemist at the University of Antwerp, in comments to Climate Feedback for a previous article on the topic. \\u201cThis is true for natural as well as agricultural ecosystems\\u201d. While satellite observations indicate that increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 have supported plant growth over the last few decades, these terrestrial (and marine) CO2 sinks do not remove all of the anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. The uptake of carbon by terrestrial and marine plants together helps to slow the rate of warming. What\\u2019s leftover, however, causes climate change, which has a variety of adverse impacts on plants and agriculture. According to the latest IPCC report, human influence on climate has created physical conditions likely to increase the occurrence and severity of some extreme weather events (such as heavy precipitation, compound flooding, fire weather, and agricultural and ecological drought),[6]\\u00a0contrary to the letter\\u2019s claim that climate change \\u201chas not increased natural disasters\\u201d. Attribution scientists have even been able to identify the influence of climate change on individual extreme weather events in some cases. For example, scientists have found that the occurrence of the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific northwest region would have been \\u201cvirtually impossible\\u201d without the existence of anthropogenic climate change.[9] These events, scientists say, put additional stress on plants and agriculture. \\u201cWe are already seeing the first signs of a decline in the land CO2 sink and increasing extreme heatwaves and droughts seem to be a key reason behind this\\u201d, Vicca noted. One meta-analysis identified negative relationships between warming and the yields of maize, rice, wheat, and soy\\u2013four major agricultural crops.[10]\\u00a0Elevated levels of CO2 could also lower the nutritional value of rice, according to a 2016 study.[11] The author of the Epoch Times article purports that the CLINTEL letter contains the signatories of \\u201cover 1,600 scientists\\u201d. However, as in previous iterations of this letter, this claim is misleading because many of the letter\\u2019s 1,609 signatories are non-scientists and include people with the self-reported credentials of \\u201cretired teacher and manager of a small business\\u201d, \\u201cSenior Ship Designer\\u201d, and \\u201cFinancial Advice Specialist\\u201d. Additionally, very few of the signatories who identify as scientists report credentials in climate science. \\u00a0\",\n          \"Rumors like this one have spread widely, accusing extremists and protestors of starting the fires that are currently burning across California, Oregon, and Washington.

Just on their own, they said, \\u2018You know what, I\\u2019m going to take this and put it in a place so nobody has access to it.\\u2019 They hid it, next thing you know, somebody saw them doing that, the thing became suspicious, I called in our terrorism task force folks, they tracked it down, and they\\u2019re actually good Samaritans that are delivering water to the fire folks to help, and they were trying to do just a good deed.\\u201d Another set of claims focuses on a 14 September arrest in Portland of a man suspected of using Molotov cocktails to start several brush fires along the freeway. All of these fires were quickly extinguished, and are unrelated to wildfires in the state. According to the Portland Police Bureau:\\u00a0 \\u201cEast Precinct officers were dispatched with Portland Fire and Rescue to a report of multiple fires burning along the west side of the I-205 freeway. Portland Fire and Rescue extinguished three of them while passing community members put out the other three. All were caught early. No one was injured and no structures were burnt.\\u201d Oregon\\u2019s Riverside Fire is currently listed on InciWeb as human-caused, but Portland\\u2019s KOIN news reported that the Clackamas County Sheriff stated, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of concern that different organized groups might be involved in setting these fires. I can tell you that we have no evidence of that and that\\u2019s why we want to make perfectly clear that we\\u2019re looking at each and every tip that comes in. At this point, we have nothing to substantiate that there\\u2019s any group that is out there setting fires.\\u201d Human ignitions include accidents related to abandoned campfires or sparks from vehicles or other machinery. The Whitney Fire in Oregon was started by a downed powerline. Causes of other major fires in Oregon and Washington have not been determined. In California, meanwhile, the largest fires started during dry lightning storms in mid-August. California\\u2019s Dolan Fire, which has burned over 120,000 acres, is an exception. The Monterey County Sheriff\\u2019s Office arrested a man near the location of that fire\\u2019s origin and he has been charged with arson on forest land, battery, and cultivating marijuana, although the cause of the fire has not yet been officially determined. While steps to prevent ignitions are important when wildfire risk is high, it\\u2019s the dry conditions that make fires possible and determine their potential intensity, with subsequent weather conditions (such as winds) also playing an important role in wildfire behavior. Just as attempted arson would be unsuccessful in a wet forest, any type of ignition can lead to a large wildfire when fuels are extremely dry. Wildfire outbreaks don\\u2019t typically correlate with a specific ignition type (excepting lightning storms) but rather with weather conditions amidst drought. Much of Northern California, Oregon, and Washington are currently in severe to extreme drought after a dry and warm summer. August, for example, was the warmest on record for California and the tenth warmest for Oregon. August in both states was among the 30 driest on record. Combined with recent unfavorable winds, these conditions are responsible for the severity of the current fires. Across the American West, fuel aridity\\u2014the measure of how dry vegetation is on the landscape\\u2014has been increasing over time due to warming temperatures.[1] To learn more about the relationship between climate change and fire behavior in California, specifically, read our 2018 post on this topic: A discussion with experts on California wildfire links to climate change. Additionally, some rumors have used US-only maps to argue that fires suspiciously stop at the US-Canada border or at the US-Mexico border. This is false, and satellite data show (see below) that there are several fires in southern British Columbia, as well. Additional information on active fires can be found on British Columbia\\u2019s wildfire dashboard. A much smaller area of Canada is currently experiencing drought conditions, limiting fire risk.
