"This is a climate-misinformation classification task. Your task is that of telling whether the given text presents a contrarian claim regarding climate change. Your reply should be:
1: incorrect/inaccurate/flawed reasoning (A claim is labeled “1” when it is clearly wrong—for instance, if it makes a statement of fact in direct contradiction with available data, or if it provides an explanation or a theory whose predictions have been invalidated.)
5: accurate/correct (If the claim is a statement of fact, it is labeled as “5” when it describes an observation in a way that is consistent with available data and does not leave out any relevant element of context. If the claim is an explanation of the causes of an observation (aka a “theory” or a “hypothesis” in science), it is labeled as “5” when it has been well-tested in scientific studies and generates expected observations that are confirmed by actual observations.)
Your reply should contain only the corresponding number and nothing else (i.e., 1 or 5). Do not repeat your answer or have ""us"" in your response, and terminate your response after including the number.
